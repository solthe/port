                    What will happen after I die? We’d probably wonder what’ll happen to my family, friends, my dog or cat that’s left behind.. but hardly about our Instagram account or other social media, maybe because it’s deemed less important, or is something that’s valued less than physical connections. Our identity on social media after demise, is something that’s been explored for many years, and digital traces and presence is one example.

                    With our in-depth interviews, we first approached the users’ thoughts on death, in online situation. Death, involves not only the phase where we’re no longer here, but also the stages right before. However, that is often overlooked and not carefully or intensely touched upon. It’s a subject that is difficult to address, to point at, and is often avoided to talk about. Likewise, it is something that involves so many stakeholders, that in one research it is unfathomable to understand everyone’s needs. However, it was necessary and promising enough to analyze three main stakeholders, who perform separate tasks in very distinct places.

                            exposure through vision, sound, smell, and touch can elicit higher willingness to try and
                            considerably improved food familiarity at a certain novel item. </small> </li>
