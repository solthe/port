      <p class="entry-summary">
        Flavors are essentially combined from the human central nervous system. Different sensory modalities are first perceived then are intertwined to produce what is called the flavor.
        Visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory and somatosensory modalities determine what is the flavor and all are interweaved more intensely than one might think.

      <p class="entry-summary">
        We tend to eat "what we normally eat". The world is full of standardized food choices, and some people have difficult time choosing an unfamiliar food over what they always eat.
        Food familiarity has shown to be directly related to food preference; people making the same and standardized food choices 
        could be the reason why we are not yet used to the diverse food choices and advanced food industries' products.

          The experiment in the preliminary study followed a Wizard of Oz method; a human “wizard” performed the role “chatbot” instead of using the actual chatbots.
          Therefore, participants brainstormed through chat messenger while both parties were in separate rooms. Furthermore, the participants communicated via texting with the AI agent without knowing that a human “wizard” was performing the AI role behind the scenes.
          A few days before the experiment, the experimenter sent the participants a web address for the NEO-PI-R-based BFM personality type test to determine their personality type, especially their extroverted personality.
          We recruited students aged 20 to 30, regardless of gender, from one university and conducted brainstorming experiments with 20 students.

      <span class="entry-summary">After the experiment, 15 out of 20 participants (75%) said they thought the brainstorming process was with real AI agents. They did not realize a human wizard was behind them until the experimenter revealed the experimental method.
      In addition, almost everyone seemed to have accepted the two AI personas, Di-bot and Co-bot, as they designed in the study.</span>

        “Di-bot seemed cheerful and talkative. You know, there is always one on the team who
         talks a lot and lifts the mood. However, as this AI is designed for collaborative ideation, it not only talked a lot but also suggested lots of ideas. I hope to get one soon." (p.8).

      <span class="entry-summary">First, we observed that people with introverted personalities interact more freely and without a burden in brainstorming with the AI chatbots, unlike conventional brainstorming with humans.
        Second, we observed that the extroverted participants showed some differences in their experiences from the introverted people.
        Extroverts felt that interaction with the AI chatbot was not satisfying enough because they thought the most important aspect of brainstorming was interacting with other humans.

          <br> We designed the experiment where participants watched two brainstorming examples videos with the two AI personas and answered the questionnaire.
          The videos showed a sample dialogue from a human–AI collaboration process, and they were created based on the actual conversation data from the preliminary experiment. 
          Then, we asked each participant to answer the questions after watching two consecutive videos that showed an example of the collaborative ideation process with the two AI personas.
          <br> <br> The questionnaire consisted of 24 personality test questions and 18 experimental questions on a five-point Likert scale (1: strongly disagree, 2: disagree, 3: neither agree nor disagree, 4: agree, 5: disagree), distributed after each collaboration video.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b> AI chatbots could overcome the existing limitations of brainstorming.
            </b> <br> <small>In this study, participants showed they thought they had the following advantages in the brainstorming process through chatbots. First, it was easy to check the previous conversation history. Second, it was easy to grasp the entire conversation flow regardless of the speed of the conversation. Third, it was easy to organize their thoughts and continue the conversation before chatting. </small> </li>
          <li><b>Need for segmented research depending on the purpose of AI collaboration.
            </b> <br> <small>  Given that some participants responded positively to the sympathetic attitude of the AI agent, determining which characteristics are best suited to such a purpose needs further research.</small></li>
          <li><b> Limitations and future research direction.
            </b> <br> <small> 
             Wizard of Oz experiments are less likely to be distorted, but there still exist limitations.
             Designing an AI agent capable of an actual collaboration process suited for particular conversations for the brainstorming process is immediately feasible by employing different scenarios.</small></li>
