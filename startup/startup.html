                goal, to have their own unique technology be distributed to different parts of the world. Its aim and
                philosophy centered on technology innovation in their cosmetics and skincare products, while growing
                their capital to foreign markets.

                As I tried to launch the product that had low recognition and capital, I made a list of every potential

                Preparing presentations, doing the presentations and being rejected by countless stores, I tried to
                reach out the market through an intense user research and speaking to the owners after rejection.

                    While I was looking for more distribution channels, an email was sent to me offering a partnered OEM
                    project, targeted for the Mexican customers.
                    I was looking for a job that inquired me to get engaged further on what the local customers want
                    in the skincare market,
                    I immediately said yes. The sender was a product manager from a cosmetic shop I once met, who is now
                    my business partner.
                    We have managed to get some funding from OnDay, and launched the brand in December, 2019.
                    We also got involved in a government-funded project, the commercializing and excavating of 'the
                    Millennial Grass' by using its magical component in the product.

                    The Korean government's mission was for us to use the ingredient, millennial grass, to be commercialized and be
                    prepared for the market. This plant is a type of cacti only grown and survives in Korea,
                    known to survive for 1,000 years, and thus the millennial grass (of which we have a patent for the
                    name haha). The millennial grass is locally grown in the farms of Paju, Korea, and is known for its
                    high viscosity. We had a mission to fully incoporate this rich anti-oxidant, highly moisturizing and
                    pollution-free cactus (activated Isorhamnetin protects skin from external contact or the air
                    pollution). Eventually developed a primer named "the primer", that has anit-pollution, anit-aging
                    and moisturizing effect, targeted to hot climates. While developing its packaging concept and
                    design, we aimed for the 'girlish' market and the packaging was bold to target the young millennials
                    in Latin America. Developing the product was as follows:

We have tested three samples to select the ideal viscosity of the extract, which is known for its excessive stickiness and so for its intricacy in commercialization.
With the optimal texture, it was sent to the manufacturer for production.

                    My attempt to sell skincare in Mexico somehow arrived at its not-so-expected end, and although it is ongoing, this is how my gap year went. I was able to really understand how hard it was to knock on other country's door, simply to sell the
                     products that they do not know about, and also that strong relationships always pay off. I
                      was grateful to meet this partner whom I would have never worked with if I did not cherish 
                      the moments getting so many rejections and, bit cheesy but, built relationship with her. 
                      Finally, also being able to work in the government's mission to commercialize their local 
                      ingredient, the millennial cactus, and to help the local farm grow, is a rewarding journey. 
                      It has taught me about the interactions between one another and their realistic importance, 
                      as well as about perserverance that especially stood for me during my journey in Mexico. </p>
