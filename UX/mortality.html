                    to a smoother transition and a higher willingness to try, especially given that the hardest trait in

                        </b> <br> <small>Non-tasting element exposure has been an emerging theory to be effective for
                            food
                            neophobia for years, but it was yet to be experimented. Multisensory
                            exposure through vision, sound, smell, and touch can elicit higher willingness to try and
                            considerably improved food familiarity at a certain novel item. </small> </li>
                    <li><b>Educational aspect of multisensory interface.
                        </b> <br> <small> A nutrition and education professional commented such multisensory
                        experience can simultaneously be an education on technology uses on younger audiences, and not
                        just a food education. </small></li>
                    <li><b> Further usages.
                        </b> <br> <small> Most participants established that a multi-sensorial experience gives an opportunity for an objective decision making, better understanding on the novel food and drastically improved familiarity.</small></li>
                    <li> <b> Multisensory approach in HCI </b><br> <small> Multisensorial integrations can set guidelines for a stimulative and informative strategy to arouse curiosity to try new food sources in the future or assist those in need of sensory complementation.</small></li>
