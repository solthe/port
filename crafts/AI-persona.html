        Brainstorming and cooperative idea generation have been a vital solution technique for many years.
        A proven theory is that the group members' personlity type combination tremendously affects the work outcome and

        An exploratory study examining whether the same applies to the human-AI collaboration is in grave need.

          The experiment in the preliminary study followed a Wizard of Oz method; a human “wizard” performed the role “chatbot” instead of using the actual chatbots.
          Therefore, participants brainstormed through chat messenger while both parties were in separate rooms. Furthermore, the participants communicated via texting with the AI agent without knowing that a human “wizard” was performing the AI role behind the scenes.
          A few days before the experiment, the experimenter sent the participants a web address for the NEO-PI-R-based BFM personality type test to determine their personality type, especially their extroverted personality.
          We recruited students aged 20 to 30, regardless of gender, from one university and conducted brainstorming experiments with 20 students.

        <span class="entry-byline meta" style="font-size:0.8em">Based on the findings from the first study, we designed the follow-up study to extend this area of investigation by a quantitative approach with a larger number of participants. </span>
        <p class="entry-summary">
          <br> We designed the experiment where participants watched two brainstorming examples videos with the two AI personas and answered the questionnaire.
          The videos showed a sample dialogue from a human–AI collaboration process, and they were created based on the actual conversation data from the preliminary experiment. 
          Then, we asked each participant to answer the questions after watching two consecutive videos that showed an example of the collaborative ideation process with the two AI personas.
          <br> <br> The questionnaire consisted of 24 personality test questions and 18 experimental questions on a five-point Likert scale (1: strongly disagree, 2: disagree, 3: neither agree nor disagree, 4: agree, 5: disagree), distributed after each collaboration video.</p>

      <span class="entry-summary">We checked whether they recognized the AI personas as we intended through the answers to the first five questions (Q25 to Q28)
        Next, we performed a paired t-test to check the difference in the five questions (Q25 to Q28) using a total of 44 answer sheets.
        From the results, we found a significant difference in Q26, Q27, and Q28 with a significance level of 0.05.

        This study shed light on the possibility of utilizing AI chatbots to overcome the limitations of conventional human–human brainstorming, especially among introverts.

          <li><b> AI chatbots could overcome the existing limitations of brainstorming.
            </b> <br> <small>In this study, participants showed they thought they had the following advantages in the brainstorming process through chatbots. First, it was easy to check the previous conversation history. Second, it was easy to grasp the entire conversation flow regardless of the speed of the conversation. Third, it was easy to organize their thoughts and continue the conversation before chatting. </small> </li>
          <li><b>Need for segmented research depending on the purpose of AI collaboration.
            </b> <br> <small>  Given that some participants responded positively to the sympathetic attitude of the AI agent, determining which characteristics are best suited to such a purpose needs further research.</small></li>
          <li><b> Limitations and future research direction.
            </b> <br> <small> 
             Wizard of Oz experiments are less likely to be distorted, but there still exist limitations.
             Designing an AI agent capable of an actual collaboration process suited for particular conversations for the brainstorming process is immediately feasible by employing different scenarios.</small></li>
